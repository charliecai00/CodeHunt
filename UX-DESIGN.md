## Design Ideas
We want to keep the app simple as the purpose of this app is to save people's time. So the app should not bring in some complex functionalities. It should be easy, intuitive to use at first hand.

Each box represents a unique design template. The home page should also be the contest view by default. The contest view has two parts. The count-down view displays the events with count time in the time order. The calendar view displays events on a calendar of each date. The user page and setting is integrated into one view because a lot of functionalities can be hard to distinctly categorized. The about me view displays the information of the team and link to GitHub.
